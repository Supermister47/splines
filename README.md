# Splines

This prototype offers a visual demostration of how much a piecewise cubic interpolation is affected when adding new points to the dataset or when existing points are modified.

```Left click``` to add a point or move an existing one.

Press ```Delete``` while dragging a point to delete it.

Use the ```Left``` and ```Right``` keys to change colors.

To run the program in Windows, you can execute Splines.exe. However, OpenJDK 17 has to be installed on your computer. Alternatively, you can open the [sketch](source/Splines.pde) in Processing 4.3 and run it from there.
